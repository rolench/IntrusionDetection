# IntrusionDetection

This is my solution for a Computer Vision project about intrusion detection. It was requested for "COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE PROCESSING M" course held by Professor Di Stefano at Unibo.

The task is to develop a software system that, based on automatic video analysis, can detect objects (intruders) that do not belong to a static reference scene (background) and establish which of such objects are persons.
